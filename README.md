# Fork

Fork of the JDK to experiment with a new version of the AsyncGetCallTrace call (and code reuse regarding stack walking).

It should work with JMC and related tools.
For using the AsyncGetStackTrace, we recommend using a modified [async-profiler](https://github.com/SAP/async-profiler/tree/parttimenerd_asgst).

For more information and a demo, please refer to [asgct2-demo](https://github.com/parttimenerd/asgct2-demo).
